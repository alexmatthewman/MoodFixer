You're only here for a while.

Of all our transient things, 
The greatest of our treasures,
Are our happy carefree smile,
Our joie de vie and pleasures.

Guard them and hoard them,
To share with the deserving
Fun shared is multiplied 
But plenty are exploiting.

Plant the seeds of happiness
Till the field stretches miles,
Try not to be too serious,
And always carry your smile."", ""smile.png"", ""502"", ""1"")",,,,,
